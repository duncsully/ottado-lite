The broad concept of OttaDo is to provide an app that can help anyone be more productive and feel more fulfilled. 

To start, ottado-lite was created with the intention of being an offline-first, mobile-first PWA for free so that after downloading the initial files, a user could use the app without needing an account, internet conneciton, or subscription. Being based upon web technology alone, however, leaves it with some limitations. I will likely write a new version of OttaDo that runs as native mobile apps for access to things like notifications.

Originally, OttaDo was only intended to be used on a whim, to replace other attention-demanding apps users frequented, such as social media. A user would come up with a list of things they could do, that they _ought_ to do, and then the app would simply give them a random thing to do instead of whatever they would normally do when habitually checking their phone.

But over the course of developing OttaDo, I realized I didn't have as much a problem with habitual phone checking as I did with being unproductive in general. After reading Getting Things Done, I reimagined OttaDo as a productivity app that implemented some of its systems, as well as pieces of other systems that I learned about. 

At first I thought it was merely getting easily overwhelmed at seeing my todo list pile up, so I decided to only show the top two items by default. Then I thought it was when I had off days, I didn't have the time and/or energy to do what was my top task, so I should have filters for time and energy.

I thought through sheer discipline I could become more productive if I simply had a tool to help me organize tasks to do.

Gradually I'm learning about how much of it comes down to emotional problems, and I can only do my best to get technology to help me address them.

The result is an app that's quite the work in progress. It's a live reflection of my ability to be happy and productive, and what currently gets in my way. 

My end goal is to create an all-encompassing lifestyle app, helping you manage your priorities, your time, and your emotions.
